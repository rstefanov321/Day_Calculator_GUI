# Day_Calculator_GUI
A GUI allowing the user to select two dates and be shown the absolute difference between them. 


The year selection can be changed as per developer's wish, the current range is 1990-2200 for faster loading.
The "CLICK TO UPDATE" buttons show the current date selection.

In addition to this:
Firstly, the local and the UTC time is displayed when the program is called.

Secondly, a Birthday calculator is available to show how many days you have lived. :)

Lastly, a real time clock is displayed in AM format, together with current date.

Here are some screenshots:
